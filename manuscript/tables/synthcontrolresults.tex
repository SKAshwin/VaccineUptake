	\caption*{\footnotesize{Notes: \textbf{p-values}, not standard errors, in parantheses. Estimates for the gap between Synthetic (untreated) Colorado and real Colorado were available everyday from 15 April to 30 June, but only select few were reported for brevity. All post-treatment gaps are statistically insignificant from 0. Covariates of real and each synthetic Colorado (constructed for each possible dependent variable) in the second section of the table. Covariates were selected based on what Table \ref{eq:crosssection} revealed to be most predictive - with finer controls for age group; a version of Model \ref{eq:crosssection} was estimated with finer age controls and found the number of children and elderly to be highly significant, although this was omitted for brevity.  Synthetic Colorado was constructed, ultimately, using only a few states as weights, in all designs, and their weights are listed in the third section of the table.}}
