Question:

At the end of 2021 the share of the population fully vaccinated against Covid-19 differed
widely across US States (see Figure 1).
a) Identify and evaluate the main economic and social factors giving rise to this
outcome.
b) On the basis of your answer to a), suggest how high vaccination rates might be
achieved across the entire United States

----

Planned focus: Media coverage on the vaccine, and FOX news
Solution: more attempt to engage in advocacy for the vaccine on these right-wing networks

Instrument for media coverage/Republican membership: FOX news channel position
Idea: more FOX news viewership → lower vaccination rates

Reduced form regression: rural status, Republican membership, total cumulative covid cases/deaths in that county, demographic factors, educational attainment

throw some of these into a panel but exogeneity is questionable there?

Can also check for effect of income grants on vaccination rates. Can use the Biden stimulus checks: these were sent out over March 2021 (see https://www.aarp.org/money/taxes/info-2020/irs-timeline-to-send-stimulus-funds.html), and had equal nominal value, so vastly differing real values by county. Note the timing of these checks was staggered non-randomly’ based on whether previous income tax info was available. The vast majority of checks were on March 12/19 and April 2. The April 2 payment was for those with no previous tax return, and so likely the poorest, worth noting.

Bill was signed around March 11, though widely expected.

Can also use the expiry of the unemployment insurance top-up, but this was known in advance.

County level unemployment data available here. The unemployment benefit expiry was a larger income shock in counties that had more unemployment to begin with.

This tells us that why Adults arent vaccinated, as of end 2021. Almost no one (2%) is due to inability to access the vaccine.
